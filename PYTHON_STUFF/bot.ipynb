       "'# 2FA/OTP Bypass\\n\\n\\n\\n## **Enhanced Two-Factor Authentication Bypass Techniques**\\n\\n### **Direct Endpoint Access**\\n\\nTo bypass 2FA, access the subsequent endpoint directly, knowing the path is crucial. If unsuccessful, alter the **Referrer header** to mimic navigation from the 2FA verification page.\\n\\n### **Token Reuse**\\n\\nReutilizing previously used tokens for authentication within an account can be effective.\\n\\n### **Utilization of Unused Tokens**\\n\\nExtracting a token from one\\'s own account to bypass 2FA in another account can be attempted.\\n\\n### **Exposure of Token**\\n\\nInvestigate whether the token is disclosed in a response from the web application.\\n\\n### **Verification Link Exploitation**\\n\\nUsing the **email verification link sent upon account creation** can allow profile access without 2FA, as highlighted in a detailed [post](https://srahulceh.medium.com/behind-the-scenes-of-a-security-bug-the-perils-of-2fa-cookie-generation-496d9519771b).\\n\\n### **Session Manipulation**\\n\\nInitiating sessions for both the user\\'s and a victim\\'s account, and completing 2FA for the user\\'s account without proceeding, allows an attempt to access the next step in the victim\\'s account flow, exploiting backend session management limitations.\\n\\n### **Password Reset Mechanism**\\n\\nInvestigating the password reset function, which logs a user into the application post-reset, for its potential to allow multiple resets using the same link is crucial. Logging in with the newly reset credentials might bypass 2FA.\\n\\n### **OAuth Platform Compromise**\\n\\nCompromising a user\\'s account on a trusted **OAuth** platform (e.g., Google, Facebook) can offer a route to bypass 2FA.\\n\\n### **Brute Force Attacks**\\n\\n#### **Rate Limit Absence**\\n\\nThe lack of a limit on the number of code attempts allows for brute force attacks, though potential silent rate limiting should be considered.\\n\\n#### **Slow Brute Force**\\n\\nA slow brute force attack is viable where flow rate limits exist without an overarching rate limit.\\n\\n#### **Code Resend Limit Reset**\\n\\nResending the code resets the rate limit, facilitating continued brute force attempts.\\n\\n#### **Client-Side Rate Limit Circumvention**\\n\\nA document details techniques for bypassing client-side rate limiting.\\n\\n#### **Internal Actions Lack Rate Limit**\\n\\nRate limits may protect login attempts but not internal account actions.\\n\\n#### **SMS Code Resend Costs**\\n\\nExcessive resending of codes via SMS incurs costs to the company, though it does not bypass 2FA.\\n\\n#### **Infinite OTP Regeneration**\\n\\nEndless OTP generation with simple codes allows brute force by retrying a small set of codes.\\n\\n### **Race Condition Exploitation**\\n\\nExploiting race conditions for 2FA bypass can be found in a specific document.\\n\\n### **CSRF/Clickjacking Vulnerabilities**\\n\\nExploring CSRF or Clickjacking vulnerabilities to disable 2FA is a viable strategy.\\n\\n### **\"Remember Me\" Feature Exploits**\\n\\n#### **Predictable Cookie Values**\\n\\nGuessing the \"remember me\" cookie value can bypass restrictions.\\n\\n#### **IP Address Impersonation**\\n\\nImpersonating the victim\\'s IP address through the **X-Forwarded-For** header can bypass restrictions.\\n\\n### **Utilizing Older Versions**\\n\\n#### **Subdomains**\\n\\nTesting subdomains may use outdated versions lacking 2FA support or contain vulnerable 2FA implementations.\\n\\n#### **API Endpoints**\\n\\nOlder API versions, indicated by /v\\\\*/ directory paths, may be vulnerable to 2FA bypass methods.\\n\\n### **Handling of Previous Sessions**\\n\\nTerminating existing sessions upon 2FA activation secures accounts against unauthorized access from compromised sessions.\\n\\n### **Access Control Flaws with Backup Codes**\\n\\nImmediate generation and potential unauthorized retrieval of backup codes upon 2FA activation, especially with CORS misconfigurations/XSS vulnerabilities, poses a risk.\\n\\n### **Information Disclosure on 2FA Page**\\n\\nSensitive information disclosure (e.g., phone number) on the 2FA verification page is a concern.\\n\\n### **Password Reset Disabling 2FA**\\n\\nA process demonstrating a potential bypass method involves account creation, 2FA activation, password reset, and subsequent login without the 2FA requirement.\\n\\n### **Decoy Requests**\\n\\nUtilizing decoy requests to obfuscate brute force attempts or mislead rate limiting mechanisms adds another layer to bypass strategies. Crafting such requests requires a nuanced understanding of the application\\'s security measures and rate limiting behaviors.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n* [https://medium.com/@iSecMax/two-factor-authentication-security-testing-and-possible-bypasses-f65650412b35](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks/blob/master/pentesting-web/%22https:/medium.com/@iSecMax/two-factor-authentication-security-testing-and-possible-bypasses-f65650412b35%22/README.md)\\n* [https://azwi.medium.com/2-factor-authentication-bypass-3b2bbd907718](https://azwi.medium.com/2-factor-authentication-bypass-3b2bbd907718)\\n\\n<details>\\n\\n<summary><strong>Learn AWS hacking from zero to hero with</strong> <a href=\"https://training.hacktricks.xyz/courses/arte\"><strong>htARTE (HackTricks AWS Red Team Expert)</strong></a><strong>!</strong></summary>\\n\\nOther ways to support HackTricks:\\n\\n* If you want to see your **company advertised in HackTricks** or **download HackTricks in PDF** Check the [**SUBSCRIPTION PLANS**](https://github.com/sponsors/carlospolop)!\\n* Get the [**official PEASS & HackTricks swag**](https://peass.creator-spring.com)\\n* Discover [**The PEASS Family**](https://opensea.io/collection/the-peass-family), our collection of exclusive [**NFTs**](https://opensea.io/collection/the-peass-family)\\n* **Join the** üí¨ [**Discord group**](https://discord.gg/hRep4RUj7f) or the [**telegram group**](https://t.me/peass) or **follow** us on **Twitter** üê¶ [**@carlospolopm**](https://twitter.com/hacktricks\\\\_live)**.**\\n* **Share your hacking tricks by submitting PRs to the** [**HackTricks**](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks) and [**HackTricks Cloud**](https://github.com/carlospolop/hacktricks-cloud) github repos.\\n\\n</details>'"
